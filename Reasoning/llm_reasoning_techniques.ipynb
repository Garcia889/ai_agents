            "   - **OpenAI Solution**: This solution is more concise and direct, focusing on the calculations themselves without as much narrative explanation. It assumes the reader understands the context and focuses on the mathematical operations.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Explanation and Detail**:\n",
            "   - **GPT-4o Solution**: Provides more detailed explanations for each step, including intermediate results, which can be helpful for readers who need more context or are less familiar with the calculations.\n",
